a) o(1)

b)o(n^2)

c)o(n)

exercise 2

I would make a function that randomly picks a floor hoping that i am lucky enought to get a floor close to the answer. then depending on the floor i start on i would test the egg drop if it doesnt break i would go up if it does break i would go down until i reach the floor
going it this way would remove a bunch of floors that i wouldnt have to check

i believe it would make the time complexity 0(logn) 

my old idea the last sprint was to start from the bottom up and work my way up until i reach the floor which i believe that would be o(n) since it has to go through a certain amount of numbers, this new function would reduce that depending on the random number so I theres a good chance i would have to check less floors than if i would have started at floor 1
