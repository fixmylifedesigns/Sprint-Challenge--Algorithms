exercise 2

i would create a function that starts at floor one and countinues to go as many floors as their are until f is reached.
drop an egg in floor 0 if egg breaks f = true. if egg doesnt break f = false and +1 to floor and run function again.

this function is really only doing one thing and the time the function will run will not change because it will always check one floor at a time and drop an egg so i believe it is o(n)
